# A persistent rope: the text structure Griddle is built on.
#
# Ported from MojoCocoa's ide/rope.mojo, near enough unchanged. The rope is
# the one part of an editor with nothing platform-specific in it, and the two
# ports agreeing on it is worth more than either inventing its own: this file
# should travel back through the oracle so a fix in one is a fix in both.
#
# A B-tree over UTF-8 leaves. Every node caches the bytes and newlines beneath
# it, so line->offset and offset->line are O(log n) walks rather than scans, and
# a 250,000-line file is a small case rather than the ceiling.
#
# The important property is that nodes are immutable and shared. An edit copies
# only the path from the touched leaf to the root -- four nodes at this depth --
# and returns a new root; every other node is shared with the previous version.
# That single property pays three times over, and the editor is designed around
# it:
#
#   * Undo is a stack of old roots. Structural sharing makes a thousand-entry
#     history cost kilobytes, so there are no command objects and no inverse
#     operations to get wrong.
#   * A snapshot is one pointer copy, so background work -- LSP sync, search,
#     saving -- reads a consistent tree on another queue with no lock while the
#     main thread keeps editing.
#   * A save cannot tear, because the tree it serialises cannot change.
#
# The UTF-16 counts the Mac port keeps because Cocoa thinks in them are, if
# anything, more load-bearing here: TSF hands positions in UTF-16, DirectWrite
# measures in UTF-16, and every W-suffixed Win32 entry point speaks it. Keeping
# the count on every node means a text-store query is a walk rather than a
# scan.
#
# Byte offsets throughout. Mojo makes the choice explicit at every slice
# (`s[byte=a:b]` versus `s[codepoint=a:b]`), which is the right pressure for a
# text editor: the rope indexes bytes, and only the view layer thinks in
# characters.
