# Talks to the real mojo-lsp-server: spawn it, initialize, open a file with a
# deliberate error in it, and read the diagnostics back.
#
# Ported from MojoCocoa's ide/lsp_test.mojo. The framing, handshake and
# diagnostics checks are theirs unchanged and pass here unchanged, which is
# the point: the protocol half of the client is shared and only the
# transport underneath it is per-platform. The last check is the one that
# had to differ -- theirs asks for an Objective-C selector out of
# cocoa.sqlite, and this fork's equivalent is sprint 2.4's work.
#
# No window and no event loop -- poll() is driven from a plain loop here and
# from a timer in the app, which is the only difference between them.
