# The data model: what an ABC tune becomes once it has been read.
#
# Two decisions shape everything else here.
#
# **Time is an integer.** Durations are counted in ticks at 480 per quarter
# note -- 1920 per whole note -- and never in seconds or doubles. That number
# is the standard MIDI resolution and it divides exactly by everything ABC can
# ask for: a 1/64 note is 30 ticks, a triplet eighth is 160, a dotted quarter
# is 720. Nothing rounds, so a tune that should land on the bar line does,
# however many tuplets and dots came before it. Floating-point timestamps drift
# by a fraction of a tick per note, which is inaudible until a few hundred
# notes have gone by and the voices are visibly apart.
#
# **A key signature is arithmetic, not a table.** The alteration a key applies
# to a letter follows from the circle of fifths, so `key_alter` computes it
# rather than storing seven numbers per key. The whole of Western key
# signatures is two orderings of the same seven letters.
