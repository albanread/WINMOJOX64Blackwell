# Repeats, expanded properly -- including first and second endings.
#
# `|: A |1 B :|2 C |` plays A B A C. That is the whole point of the notation
# and it is the case naive expanders get wrong: duplicating the text between
# `|:` and `:|` gives A B A B, so the tune ends on the wrong phrase every
# time. Endings are not decoration; they are how a repeated strain gets out
# of itself.
#
# The expansion works on events rather than on text. By this point every note
# already knows its voice and its length, so replaying a section is copying a
# range and re-stamping the clock -- and a repeat that crosses a line break,
# or sits inside one voice of several, needs no special handling at all.
