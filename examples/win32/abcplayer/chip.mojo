# --- vendored from the Mac port's examples/abcplayer/chip.mojo ---
# abcplayer reuses the chip synthesiser's DSP engine. An IDE example is a
# folder that opens and runs with no include flags, so the synth lives here as
# a copy rather than as a cross-folder import.
#
# Two lines differ from the Mac copy, and only two: the state block is
# allocated through the standard library's `unsafe_alloc` rather than through
# libc's `calloc`, because `calloc` is a CRT symbol this toolchain has no
# reason to have linked and a zeroed block is two lines to write. Everything
# below that -- every oscillator, every envelope table, the filter -- is byte
# for byte the arithmetic the Mac plays.
# --- begin copy ---
# A 6581-flavoured synthesiser: three voices, ADSR, a resonant filter.
#
# Not an emulator. rechip exists, it is cycle-exact, and it is thousands of
# lines of measured analogue behaviour. This is the other thing -- the
# arithmetic that gives the 6581 its voice, written plainly, small enough to
# read in one sitting and fast enough to run under a real-time deadline.
#
# What makes it sound like a chip rather than like a generic synth:
#
#   * the oscillators are 24-bit phase accumulators, so the pitch drifts in
#     the same quantised way and the waveforms have the same hard edges
#   * the noise is the actual 23-bit LFSR with the actual output taps, which
#     is why it rasps instead of hissing
#   * the envelope decays by the chip's period-stretching table rather than
#     by an exponential curve, which is the difference between a C64 snare
#     and a beep
#   * the pulse width is a register you are expected to modulate every frame
#
# The chip is integer hardware, so this is integer arithmetic. The only
# floating point is the filter and the final sample.
#
# All state lives in one flat block, because that is what a chip is: a bank
# of registers plus some internal counters. The block is passed to the render
# callback through CoreAudio's inRefCon, so nothing here needs a global and
# two chips could run at once.
