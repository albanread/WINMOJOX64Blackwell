# Turning a tune into a list of things to do at exact sample times.
#
# This is where the timing claim is either true or not. A tick is an exact
# integer; a sample is an exact integer; the conversion between them is one
# multiply and one divide in 64-bit, rounded once. Nothing accumulates.
#
# The alternative -- the one their C++ uses and the one most players use -- is
# to work in seconds as doubles and sleep until each event is due:
#
#     std::this_thread::sleep_until(start + seconds(event_time));
#
# That asks the operating system to wake a thread at a moment, which it will
# do late by whatever the scheduler is busy with: a millisecond or two idle,
# tens under load. At 120bpm a semiquaver is 125 ms, so a 5 ms error is 4% of
# a note -- audible as looseness, and worse, it varies. Scheduling by sample
# index instead means an event lands on the sample it was written for, and the
# only jitter left is the buffer boundary, which the loop already knows about
# and can subtract exactly.
#
# A Step carries BOTH the sample and the tick it came from. That is the one
# structural change the Windows port makes to the Mac original, and it is what
# keeps the two backends sharing one schedule here. The chip is rendered by
# this program, so it wants samples. The system synthesiser is not: Windows
# takes a whole tick-stamped event list and schedules it against its own
# clock, so it wants ticks. Deriving one from the other after the fact would
# round twice; carrying both rounds once, in the same place, for both.
