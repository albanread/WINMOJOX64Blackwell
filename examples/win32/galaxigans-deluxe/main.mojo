# GalaxigansDeluxe -- a Galaxian/Galaga-style fixed shooter: the complete port
# of MACVM's Galaxigans (world/49_galaxigans.mst, itself a faithful port of the
# x64 assembler original) onto the Mojo game pane.
#
# What "complete" means, against examples/galaxigans (the BASIC port): the
# ten-species creature library and the twelve-level table with the original's
# cosmos shaders; the dive AI whose random seed IS the flight plan; the bonus
# saucer with its beating warble and its rare spinning mine; the CAPTURE BOSS
# with a tractor beam that comes for the pilot row -- drawn once as a cone in
# palette index 1 and animated by rewriting what index 1 means on each
# scanline (the copper-bar trick, through the pane's per-line palette); the
# victory dance the survivors perform over the game-over card; the four
# melodic cues, played on the system General MIDI synth as MACVM plays them;
# and a hall of fame that survives a restart.
#
# Every constant is the original's (galaxigans_data.inc, by way of the .mst):
# a 640x360 field, an 8x5 formation on a 56x34 grid from (96,56), sway +/-16
# at 1px a frame, a dive every 60 frames that peels for 12 then homes, four
# bullets at 7px a frame on an 8-frame cooldown, six bombs at 4px every 22, a
# saucer every 420 frames worth 200, a 90-frame respawn beat. It was tuned at
# ~30 frames a second, so it steps at 30 Hz on a fixed clock however fast the
# display runs.
#
# Controls: Left/Right steer, Space fires -- one shot per press, no autofire
# (the original's shoot_held / shoot_release beat). Escape quits.
#
# GAMEPANE_FRAMES=n renders n frames headless and prints a one-line summary.
# With nobody at the keys an autopilot plays (also GDX_AUTOPLAY=1 with a
# window), so a headless run exercises the whole game and not just the title.
