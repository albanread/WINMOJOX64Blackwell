# ===----------------------------------------------------------------------=== #
# A 6581-flavoured synthesiser: three voices, ADSR, a resonant filter.
#
# Not an emulator. rechip exists, it is cycle-exact, and it is thousands of
# lines of measured analogue behaviour. This is the other thing -- the
# arithmetic that gives the 6581 its voice, written plainly, small enough to
# read in one sitting and fast enough to run under a real-time deadline.
#
# What makes it sound like a chip rather than like a generic synth:
#
#   * the oscillators are 24-bit phase accumulators, so the pitch drifts in
#     the same quantised way and the waveforms have the same hard edges
#   * the noise is the actual 23-bit LFSR with the actual output taps, which
#     is why it rasps instead of hissing
#   * the envelope decays by the chip's period-stretching table rather than
#     by an exponential curve, which is the difference between a C64 snare
#     and a beep
#   * the pulse width is a register you are expected to modulate every frame
#
# The chip is integer hardware, so this is integer arithmetic. The only
# floating point is the filter and the final sample.
#
# All state lives in one flat block, because that is what a chip is: a bank
# of registers plus some internal counters. The block's address is the only
# thing the audio thread is given, so nothing here needs a global and two
# chips could run at once.
#
# Every function here is a `def` with no `raises`, which in this dialect is
# the non-raising, C-callable kind. That is not decoration: the whole file is
# reachable from the audio thread's loop body, where raising is not a way of
# reporting anything -- it is a way of leaving the speaker empty.
#
# Difference from the Mac version this was ported from: the sample rate is a
# register rather than a compile-time constant, because on Windows the shared
# mixer states the rate and the program has to accept it. See `S_RATE`.
